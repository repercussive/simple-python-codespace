# Python Codespaces template

Use this template to quickly get started writing simple Python console applications.

## Steps

### Create a codespace

At the top of the [repository page](https://github.com/repercussive/simple-python-codespace), click "Code" -> "Create codespace on main". This can take a couple minutes to set up.

### Ensure the necessary extensions are installed

With the codespace open in your browser, head to the Extensions pane and make sure that the Python extension is installed.

After running the program, you should see "Hello world!" appear in the terminal.

### Stop the codespace when you're finished using it.

Free codespace usage is time-limited. To stop the codespace, click "Codespaces" in the very bottom left corner. A set of options will appear at the top of the screen - select "Stop Current Codespace".

## Tips

### Copy file path

To get the path of a file, right-click a file in the Explorer pane and click "Copy Path".
